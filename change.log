1.0.5
- added an option to save on map generation back;
- added an option to save on death of player pawns;
- aded minimum interval between saves of 1000 ticks;

1.0.4
- added an "autosaving" popup;

1.0.3
- notification about map being generated appears to be exceptionally inconsistent,
  it could be called on any stage of map generation, so often saves could happen 
  before pawns actually entered generated map or map could have enemies not being hostile. 
  This feature requires a (painfully excessive) rework, so I've disabled it for now.

- added Chinese Simplified translation;

1.0.1
- updated for 1.2;

1.0.0
- release, yay!
